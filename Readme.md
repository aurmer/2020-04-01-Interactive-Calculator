# Objective: Interactive Calculator

This is my entry into a hackathon during which I had 2.25hr to develop an
interactive calculator. They suggested a tip calculator or something with 2-3
inputs, but having a feel for my own skill and pacing, I decided to do a grade
school math calculator.

I used my operating system's Calculator application as a model, and focused on
the state transition between button presses. Every button sequence on this app
gives the same result as Microsoft's Calculator (like press the decimal point
or 0 multiple times).

This is what I was able to complete in the time allotted, stretch goals I was
unable to reach include
 - Keystroke event handling (use the app with the numpad)
 - visual feedback on Operator selection
 - truncation of output to always fit container

Overall, a great experience, delivering code under a hard time constraint.
